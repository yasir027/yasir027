🧠 I enjoy bridging tech and usability—whether it's creating legal-tech platforms like **ALD Online**, AI-powered education tools like **SLATE**, or location-aware systems like **Busway**. I'm also exploring AI agents using **n8n**, **OpenAI APIs**, and cloud workflows.

💡 I’ve built projects across **legal**, **healthcare**, **ed-tech**, **e-commerce**, and **developer tooling**, and I love working at the intersection of functionality and innovation.
