## 🌍 About Me

I'm Yasir — a full stack developer with over **3 years of experience** delivering scalable, user-centric web applications. From building legal-tech platforms to AI-integrated education tools and real-time object detection systems, I enjoy solving meaningful problems with clean code and sharp design.

I’ve worked across industries like **healthcare**, **legal**, **ed-tech**, and **developer tools**, and I’m passionate about crafting software that not only works—but **works smart**.

I’m also building **Tech Job Insider (TJI)**—a social media concept for developers to share code outputs as posts. Think Stack Overflow meets Instagram.
